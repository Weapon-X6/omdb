```python
import os
import requests
params = {"apikey": os.environ["DJANGO_OMDB_KEY"], "t": "ben stiller"}
resp = requests.get("https://www.omdbapi.com/", params=params)
# URL called: https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=<key>&t=ben+stiller
print(resp.json())
```

running django
```
python manage.py runserver
```
also run Celery in another terminal
```
celery -A course4_proj worker -l DEBUG
```
